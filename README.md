### How to build Django project

1. Star with installing django framework:
- `pip install django` or `pip3 install django`
2. Clone project
3. Now from project root you need to create venv
- Run `python -m venv myenv` or `python3 -m venv myenv`
- Now you have to active it like so `ource myenv/bin/activate`
4. In project root run we need to install dependencies
- Run `pip install`. I'm not 100% sure if this command will work. So you have to Google it.
5. Once dependencies are installed you can start a project and fo to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
- From project root Run `python manage.py runserver`
